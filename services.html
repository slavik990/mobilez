Today the mobile industry world is becoming more popular. The number of users increases, so the demand for the development of mobile software is growing. There is a growing demand for high quality products that are on the market. Clients who are aware of it often turn to the improvement of existing products, with the creation of an existing product documentation and application creating from scratch. All these services are provided by Mobilez365. Creating of the product from scratch involves the following steps: a study of ideas, analysis, and the process of development which starts only after a detailed study, which often culminates with its support.

      <h2>APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h2>
      <div class="text">
The main part of work is App development, which combines many resources and consists of a long multi step process. This is the most demanding and time-consuming part of the job which is responsible for the final result. It is always performed in a close collaboration and interaction within the team members as well as our clients and their developing teams. On the basis of this the communication and understanding is the key to success. 
Each project begins with determination of the estimate for its development which is consistent with the client.
All the technical details are reflected in the specification. It is important not only for the development process, but also for prototyping and for testing. We collaborate with the ideas of clients and we are inspired by the original intention of the customer but we often suggest better alternatives based on our experience and high skill and let them see the project concept from a different angle.

       All the tasks and milestones are specified in specially designed way for the company system that allows you to use it quickly and conveniently, according to specs and estimates. 
One of the most important factors in mobile app development is a perfect design. It has an impact on the app success and profitability. We try to pay much attention to this part of the design, because it sees the user. The design development is a complicated and thorough process, which needs much time and creativity. We go deep into details while pursuing the objective of creation a perfect user interface, which can be optimal for a particular case.  <br/>Maintenance, support and optimization stage is what the app release follows.
      </div>
      <h2>ANALYSIS, TESTING & SUPPORT</h2>
      <div class="text">
The procedure for testing and analysis accompanying is the whole process of developing mobile applications. Testing is required for proper operation of the application and analysis for its commercial development. Testing variability provides a better quality and quality assurance is what matters to our company. Creating a User-friendly interface is one of the points for a successful application. That is why we have introduced USABILITY TESTING to fulfill user expectations and lessen the likelihood of potential poor user experience. Our testers operate throughout the development process from prototyping, programming up to support. We also introduce different methods of application analysis. For instance, we collect analytical information about what the user likes, what is the most visited, and what he ignores. It also includes an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the application and how to resolve it. The analysis starts from prototyping up to support.
