We plan to scale from the start could mean the difference between supporting millions of users and seeing them depart in droves due to bandwidth or speed issues.</p>

                                which in turn is leading to workflow transformations. Due to massive competition, the biggest challenge for oil and gas companies is managing offshore and onshore operations.

                                The Oil and Gas industry benefits majorly from the use of custom-designed enterprise apps. Thanks to its colossal scale of operations spanning multi-country locations, big-sized teams and 
                                remote field operations that require real time communication, collaboration and quick decisions.

                                With rising population and a majority of developing nations aiming at attaining economic stability, the global demand for energy has been growing steadily. According to latest studies, the 
                                world consumes an approximate amount of 230 million barrels of oil on a daily basis with oil and gas supplying around 60% of the total demand. Thus, the need to drive complex business processes
                                and navigation of analytical data would require a set of systematic software solutions.

                                    The unforeseen risks pertaining to the processes involved in maintaining onshore and offshore assets are always on the higher side and this requires apt preventive techniques and maintenance. In oil and gas companies, there often exists a disconnect between operations and asset management systems which leads to an underutilization of capital assets, revenue losses, inefficient operations and in worst cases HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) incidents too.<br>

                                    With the onset of latest oil discoveries, the map of resource exploration has changed as the oil and gas industry is now shifting to more remote, difficult and expensive parts of the globe which automatically leads to exorbitant project costs and higher risk on capital returns also owing to oil price volatility.

                                    Materials management involves the systematic process in ensuring that the materials reach the exploration, development and production sites and the main objective is to ensure that they are of supreme quality, available whenever needed and adhere to proper safety norms. The basic need is to maintain a <strong>proper balance between low transportation costs and stock levels</strong> while ensuring their guaranteed <strong>availability and timely delivery.</strong>

Also, not knowing where the product would be located is a common problem. According to a recent study, 48% of consumers use their mobile devices to scan prices as well as check for product reviews while they are at the stores.</p>

Hospitals and clinics have complex processes and multiple data capturing centers that if arranged in a vertical pile can look like the Mount Everest of data. To make sense out of it is not humanly possible; but most certainly technologically possible. Thanks to enterprise apps.</p>
                    <p>MI helps healthcare organizations merge processes with appropriate technologies that allow deeper analysis of crucial data. Integrating multiple data centers, enabling crucial data mining and enhancing hospital workflows and data flows are some of MI's key work areas. Healthcare providers who work with MI can look forward to better process efficiencies, improved resource mobilization, enhanced productivity, quick and appropriate service delivery and finally greater patient satisfaction.

                    <p>
                        For a new-world automobile manufacturing company, both market intelligence and dealer intelligence are extremely important. To ensure both can be accessed through their fingertips, manufacturers need to look seriously at enterprise apps; as seriously as they do at developing customer car apps. MI helps automobile manufacturers by merging their internal and external functions and processes with enterprise apps that enables important data collection, analysis and action, both on the dealer and customer fronts, plus on the sales and service fronts. The perfect modern-day automobile is the one that fits into a mobile and runs with three drivers who work in complete collaboration – manufacturer, dealer and customer. MI ensures real-time, actionable interactivity between these three throughout the pre-sales, sales and service cycle leading to an improved organizational performance, satisfied dealers and happier customers.
